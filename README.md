#Description:
We are developing an native application using flutter. Our application aims to provide support to the agriculture community. Here the agriculturists can rent or lease farm machinery , look into the needs of a retailer in the nearest market and a QnA section to seek expert advice from a researcher.
At the retailerâ€™s end the retailer can propose needs and specify all his requirements such as type of commodity, quantity , quality and the date before which its required.
We will be starting our application from scratch.
